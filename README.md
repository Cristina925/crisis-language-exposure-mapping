# Crisis-Language Exposure Mapping (CLEM)

**How pre-outcome statements become evidence**

---

## Overview

Most organisational exposure does not originate from technical failure.

It originates from **language used before outcomes are known**.

During the early stages of an incident, facts are incomplete, assessments are provisional, and responsibility has not been formally established.  
Yet statements are often made — publicly or internally — that later become part of the **evidentiary record**.

Once recorded, this language cannot be undone.

---

## The Pre-Outcome Window

The **pre-outcome window** is the period in which:

- facts are still emerging  
- investigations are incomplete  
- causes and responsibility have not yet been determined  

Language used during this window is routinely cited later by:

- regulators  
- insurers  
- courts  
- public inquiries  
- parliamentary or oversight bodies  

Corrections, clarifications, or retractions do not remove the original record.

## What CLEM Is

**Crisis-Language Exposure Mapping (CLEM)** is a **recognition-level artefact**.

It isolates how statements made before outcomes are known can create:

- regulatory exposure  
- legal liability  
- insurance consequences  
- downstream accountability findings  

CLEM does **not** advise on wording.  
CLEM does **not** approve statements.  
CLEM does **not** provide legal, communications, or operational guidance.

It exists solely to **recognise exposure** so that senior decision-makers can act with awareness.

---

## Why This Matters

In many investigations, outcomes are shaped not only by what occurred,  
but by **what was said before certainty existed**.

Early language can:

- frame assumptions  
- narrow investigative interpretation  
- create implied admissions  
- establish expectations that later harden into findings  

These effects are often invisible at the time they occur.

## Intended Audience

CLEM is designed for:

- Boards and senior executives  
- General Counsel  
- Risk and compliance leaders  
- Insurers  
- Regulators and oversight bodies  
- Operators of critical or high-risk systems  

It is **not** designed for public communications, crisis management, or operational teams.

---

## Scope Boundary

CLEM is a **recognition artefact**.

It does not:

- draft or review statements  
- provide advice during incidents  
- replace legal, communications, or operational decision-making  

Its sole purpose is to identify **language-based exposure** created in the pre-outcome window.
